# Bank Marketing Term Deposit Prediction Model


# Overview


Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately classify clients as subscribers or non-subscribers to term deposits. Additionally, the project aims to identify the key factors that influence a client's decision to subscribe to a term deposit.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of 45211 rows and 17 columns, containing information about clients, their interactions with the bank, and the outcomes of previous marketing campaigns.

Methodology
The following steps were performed in this project:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the distribution of variables, handling missing values, and identifying correlations.
2. Feature Engineering: Creating new features to improve model performance.
3. Feature Scaling: Scaling numerical features to improve model convergence.
4. Model Training and Testing: Training and evaluating multiple machine learning models using cross-validation.
5. Model Selection: Selecting the best-performing model, which was the Random Forest Classifier.
6. 6. Pipeline Creation and Testing: Creating a pipeline that integrates the selected model with data preprocessing steps and testing it with unseen data to evaluate its performance in making predictions on new data.


Key Findings
Through this project, we identified the key factors that influence a client's decision to subscribe to a term deposit. The results provide valuable insights for the bank to improve their marketing strategies and increase term deposit subscription rates.
